# Ethereum Bloom Filters 

Bloom filters are a type of data structure that use cryptographic hashes
to help data stored within them to be retrieved or stored.  They work like other
data structures, but in a probabilistic way: it allows for false positive
matches but not false negative matches.  Bloom filters storage space use is
low relative to other kinds of data structures.

( For more information on Bloom filters, see Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter )

A trie is an a kind of tree data structure for use with dynamic data

Ethereum bloom filters are bloom filters implemented using a "trie" data
structure and the SHA-256 ("keccak") cryptographic hash function.
